# TDD Pair Programming Weekends

## Environment Setup
The katas on this repo were developed using JavaScript, Mocha, Chai and Babel.
For setting up the environment, just run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
If you want a cleaner env. you can use the `initial-setup` tag as your starting point by:
```
git branch <new-branch-name> initial-setup
git checkout <new-branch-name>
```

Mocha is configured to run all tests inside of the `./spec` folder and parse all code using Babel so that we can use ES2017 syntax.

## Session 1: ~~Asteroid Blues~~ Ping Pong with the string calculator.

- Pair Programming Style

### Objectives
- Abordar o basico de TDD
    + Small increments (baby steps)
        * Requirements Driven
    + Red-Green-Refactor

## TDD

- Red

- Green - Make the test pass

- Refactor

## Pair Programming

- A writes a new test and sees that it fails.
- B implements the code needed to pass the test.
- B writes the next test and sees that it fails.
- A implements the code needed to pass the test. 

## KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid

## YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
